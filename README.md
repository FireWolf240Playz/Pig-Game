# Pig-Game

This is a fun two-player game where each player takes turns rolling a pair of dice. The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach 100 points. However, if a player rolls a "1" on either die, their turn is over, and they lose all the points they accumulated during that turn. The game requires both luck and strategy, as players must decide whether to keep rolling and risk losing their points or stop and bank their points before their turn is over.
